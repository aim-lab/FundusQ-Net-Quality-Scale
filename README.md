# FundusQ-Net-Quality-Scale
This repository contains the quality scale images and scores, as described in the paper "FundusQ-Net: a Regression Quality Assessment Deep Learning Algorithm for Fundus Images Quality Grading" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01676?context=cs). The fundus images are taken from three public databases: DRISHTI-GS, ORIGA and REFUGE.
