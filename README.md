# FundusQ-Net-Quality-Scale
This repository contains the quality scale images and scores, as described in the paper "FundusQ-Net: a Regression Quality Assessment Deep Learning Algorithm for Fundus Images Quality Grading" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01676?context=cs). The fundus images are taken from three public databases: DRISHTI-GS, ORIGA and REFUGE.

## Quality Scale Example
<img src="/Quality Scale Example/Quality_Scale.png">
An example of different DFIs used for the reference set. Image A is graded as 2, image B is graded as 5, image C is graded as 7.5 and
image D is graded as 9.5. Images A, B and C are taken from the ORIGA database. Image D is taken from the REFUGE dataset.
